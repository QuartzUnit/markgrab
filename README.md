# MarkGrab

> [한국어 문서](README.ko.md)

Universal web content extraction — any URL to LLM-ready markdown.

```python
from markgrab import extract

result = await extract("https://example.com/article")
print(result.markdown)    # clean markdown
print(result.title)       # "Article Title"
print(result.word_count)  # 1234
print(result.language)    # "en"
```

## Features

- **HTML** — BeautifulSoup + content density filtering (removes nav, sidebar, ads)
- **YouTube** — transcript extraction with timestamps
- **PDF** — text extraction with page structure
- **DOCX** — paragraph and heading extraction
- **Auto-fallback** — tries lightweight httpx first, falls back to Playwright for JS-heavy pages
- **Async-first** — built on httpx and Playwright async APIs

## Install

```bash
pip install markgrab
```

Optional extras for specific content types:

```bash
pip install "markgrab[browser]"    # Playwright for JS-rendered pages
pip install "markgrab[youtube]"    # YouTube transcript extraction
pip install "markgrab[pdf]"       # PDF text extraction
pip install "markgrab[docx]"      # DOCX text extraction
pip install "markgrab[all]"       # everything
```

## Usage

### Python API

```python
import asyncio
from markgrab import extract

async def main():
    # HTML (auto-detects content type)
    result = await extract("https://example.com/article")

    # YouTube transcript
    result = await extract("https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")

    # PDF
    result = await extract("https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762")

    # Options
    result = await extract(
        "https://example.com",
        max_chars=30_000,       # limit output length (default: 50K)
        use_browser=True,       # force Playwright rendering
        stealth=True,           # anti-bot stealth scripts (opt-in)
        timeout=60.0,           # request timeout in seconds
        proxy="http://proxy:8080",
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

### CLI

```bash
markgrab https://example.com                     # markdown output
markgrab https://example.com -f text             # plain text
markgrab https://example.com -f json             # structured JSON
markgrab https://example.com --browser           # force browser rendering
markgrab https://example.com --max-chars 10000   # limit output
```

### ExtractResult

```python
result.title        # page title
result.text         # plain text
result.markdown     # LLM-ready markdown
result.word_count   # word count
result.language     # detected language ("en", "ko", ...)
result.content_type # "article", "video", "pdf", "docx"
result.source_url   # final URL (after redirects)
result.metadata     # extra metadata (video_id, page_count, etc.)
```

## How it works

```
markgrab.extract(url)
    1. Detect content type (URL pattern)
    2. Fetch content (httpx first, Playwright fallback)
    3. Parse (HTML/YouTube/PDF/DOCX)
    4. Filter (noise removal + content density + truncation)
    5. Return ExtractResult
```

For HTML pages, if the initial httpx fetch yields fewer than 50 words, MarkGrab automatically retries with Playwright to handle JavaScript-rendered content.
